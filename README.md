# Project Name: S1.01. InheritancePolymorphism

Brief description of the project and its purpose.

## üìö Exercise 1

In a music band, there are different types of musical instruments. These include wind, string, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have attributes such as `name` and `price`. Additionally, they have a method called `play()`. This method is abstract in the `Instrument` class and must therefore be implemented in the child classes.

- If a wind instrument is played, the method should display:  
  `"A wind instrument is playing"`
- If a string instrument is played:  
  `"A string instrument is playing"`
- If a percussion instrument is played:  
  `"A percussion instrument is playing"`

The class loading process only occurs once. Demonstrate that class loading can be triggered by either creating the first instance of the class or accessing a static member of it.

> üîç Research static blocks and initialization blocks in Java.

## üõª Exercise 2

Create a class called `Car` with the following attributes: `brand`, `model`, and `power`.

- `brand` should be `static final`
- `model` should be `static`
- `power` should be `final`

Demonstrate the difference between these three. Which of them can be initialized via the class constructor?

Add two methods to the `Car` class:

- A static method called `brake()`
- A non-static method called `accelerate()`

Demonstrate how to invoke both the static and non-static methods from the `main()` method in the main class.
